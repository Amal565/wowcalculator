### Project Description
[The Wow Calculator is a fun, unconventional calculator that turns simple calculations into engaging challenges, designed with hidden surprises and interactive elements. Unlike traditional calculators that instantly provide answers, the Wow Calculator encourages users to exercise their mental math skills by prompting them to manually input the answer into a popup. The calculator also includes unique Easter eggs that appear with specific results, enhancing the overall user experience.]

### The Problem 
[In today‚Äôs fast-paced world, people often rely on calculators to solve even basic math problems. This dependency reduces our mental agility and problem-solving skills over time. To combat this trend, Wow Calculator was designed to slow down the process, requiring users to calculate certain answers on their own and to be surprised by unexpected, humorous elements within the app. ]

### The Solution 
[While calculators are traditionally created for quick math solutions, the Wow Calculator adds a creative twist. It turns routine calculations into a mental exercise by requiring users to solve some problems themselves. Additionally, by incorporating playful Easter eggs, Wow Calculator engages users in a way that typical calculators do not. ]

## Technical Details

Key Features
User-Initiated Calculation:

Users are prompted to manually solve calculations in a popup and input their answers. If the answer is correct, the result displays; otherwise, an "Incorrect answer!" message appears.
Easter Eggs:

The calculator includes hidden surprises. When specific "special numbers" like 7, 10, or 369 are calculated, the calculator undergoes a temporary transformation:
All keys turn into the special number.
The result field displays the name of a famous personality, such as Cristiano Ronaldo for 7 or Mammooty for 369.
The background image changes to a custom picture, amplifying the experience.
"Death Mode":

If the result is 9, the calculator enters a ‚Äúdeath mode‚Äù where:
The background darkens.
The calculator‚Äôs border and keys glow red.
The result field shows "DEAD" in glowing red text.
The calculator becomes unusable, providing a unique (and slightly eerie) experience.
